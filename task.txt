REST API - JSON

GET /users -> Lists all users

GET /users/1 ->  Get user with id 1
GET /users/2 ->  Get user with id 2
These are dynamic routes, we cant create route for each user, they can be so many.
So, we need dynamic path parameters.
We use GET /api/users/:id
:id  <-- Variable

POST /users -> Create new user

PATCH /users/1 -> Edit user with id 1

DELETE /users/1 -> Delete user with id 1

From browsers we can only request for get.
