A middleware lies b/w client and server. It helps process, check, or change things before the response is sent.

CLIENT --> MIDDLEWARE --> SERVER

When a client sends a req to server, a middleware can access that request and do processing on it.
It can see if the request is valid. We can check, validate, who sent it. 

It can perform following actions:
1) If the request seems valid, then it can send it to server and server can access it.
2) If not, then it would send the response back to client, saying it is not valid. The req would not be passed to server.

Syntax
app.use(fn)
